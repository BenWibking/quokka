# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Email addresses or GitHub usernames can be used

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these global owners will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies any files listed below, only the user listed below
# and not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
